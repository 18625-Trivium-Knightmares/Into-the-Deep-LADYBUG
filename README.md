Make sure you are logged into Github.com.

Open "GitHub Desktop"

Make sure you are committing as yourself. If not, go to file>options.  Select the Accounts tab and log out / log in.

Check if you are working in the "TeamCode" Repository listed beneath the file menu.

Make sure you are at the branch where you want to work. It can be changed by clicking on the "current branch" to the right of the Repository. To make a new branch, click "new branch" to the right of the "filter" bar.

If you want to catch up with other people's changes, select the default master branch and click "pull origin." Then, switch to the branch you want to work with.

When finished working, switch back to the Git Hub desktop application and review your changes.  Select and right-click "Discard Changes" to reverse something you created/changed/deleted.

Select all the changes you want to commit, fill out the summary and description, and click "Commit to <Branch>."

When you are ready to copy your commits to the internet, click "Publish branch" to the right of "current branch."

When you are done working and you want to submit your changes to become part of the master branch, click "create pull request."

MAKE SURE YOU ARE SUBMITTING THE CHANGES TO THE NKN CODE AND NOT THE FTC CODE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Change "base repository" to "NKN Robotics TeamCode."

When you are ready, click "create pull request."

Ask a teammate to review the pull request, test it on the robot, then if everyone is satisfied it can be merged.
